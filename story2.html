The sapphire holds imense power and the wielder of the stone wil become invincible nothing will be able to harm or destroy the user.It also has the ability to unlock the secrets of the universe. “With a stone as powerful as the sapphire of Northwood nothing would STOP ME!!! said, TNH, But how am I going to seek out a treasure more legendary as I.Suddenly his crystal ball began to shake violently and rose up off the ground emitting a massive golden glow. The orb began to speak,”He is the one that will find the stone”. He, he who said TNH. The one with the hair a red as the embers of a burning fire, 13 years old, freckles, and tattred clothing.The orb stopped speaking and slammed down back onto the ground, causing a crack in the orb.   </p>
