  <h1>Animated Art Showcase</h1>
  <p>This collection explores my love for fantasy and magic. Featuring a growing fire, a magical cauldron, and a crystal ball telling ones future. In my concepts I was drawing inspiration from Howls moving castle and various other fantasy filled movies and shows.</p>
